js is a single threaded language meaning it can only execute one command at a time and proceeds in order, one at a time , after one another

hence synchronous code can block the code because some functions may take some time to execute and multiple such functions can stall the program for long enough

async basically means start something now and finish it later
the func executes now in a diff part and the thread resumes

fetch the data, take the response return response.json, then, catch locks

async functions always return promises
